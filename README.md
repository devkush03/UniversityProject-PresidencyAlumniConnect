🎓 Presidency Alumni Connect Platform
A full-stack web application built to connect students and alumni of Presidency University, promoting career guidance, networking, and job opportunities through structured role-based access.

📌 About the Project
The Presidency Alumni Connect Platform is a centralized portal to streamline alumni-student interaction and simplify career-related conversations. It addresses real-world issues like:

- No centralized or verified alumni directory
- Limited job/internship sharing from alumni
- Lack of formal platforms for student guidance
- No structured communication forum across batches

This platform offers a scalable and simple solution for the university ecosystem.

👥 User Roles
Admin: Manages platform content, oversees user access, moderates job/forum entries.
